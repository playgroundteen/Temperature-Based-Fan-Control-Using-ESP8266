# Temperature-Based Fan Speed Control Using ESP8266

This project aims to control the speed of a fan based on room temperature using an ESP8266 microcontroller. This ReadMe provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and key components.

## Overview

In this project, we use the ESP8266 microcontroller to read temperature data from a sensor and adjust the speed of a fan accordingly. The system ensures optimal comfort and energy efficiency by automatically adjusting the fan speed in response to temperature changes.

## Key Components

- **ESP8266**: This Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller is the brain of the project, responsible for data collection and fan control.

- **Temperature Sensor**: We use a temperature sensor (e.g., DHT11 or DHT22) to measure the room's temperature accurately.

- **Fan Speed Controller**: To adjust the fan's speed, you can use a motor driver or a solid-state relay connected to the fan.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the temperature sensor and fan speed controller to the ESP8266 microcontroller. Ensure that all connections are secure and correctly wired.

2. **Software Installation**: Upload the provided Arduino code to the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE. Make sure to install the necessary libraries if not already installed.

3. **Wi-Fi Configuration**: Modify the code to include your Wi-Fi network credentials to enable the ESP8266 to connect to your network.

4. **Calibration**: Calibrate the system by adjusting the temperature thresholds and corresponding fan speed settings in the code to suit your preferences and room conditions.

5. **Power On**: Power on the system, and the ESP8266 will begin monitoring the room temperature and adjusting the fan speed accordingly.

## Additional Information

- Make sure to provide adequate power to both the ESP8266 and the fan to ensure proper operation.

- This project can be expanded to include features like remote control through a smartphone app or integration with a home automation system.

- Always handle electrical components with care and prioritize safety when working with electricity.

- Feel free to customize the project to fit your specific needs and preferences.
